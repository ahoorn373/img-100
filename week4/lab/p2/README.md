Edit `count.php` to count up to the number submitted. For example if 7 is submitted, then the following output should be sent:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7

You don't need to change `index.php` to do this.

## Bonus challenge

Edit `index.php` to include a select form field called 'Order' that can either be 'Forwards' or 'Backwards'.

Then edit `count.php` such that when 'backwards' is selected the count is reversed eg:

7
6
5
4
3
2
1
