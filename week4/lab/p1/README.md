The images folder contains png files for some Simpsons characters. Without changing the name of the images, edit `index.php` such that an image is outputted for each character. Use a for loop.

## Bonus challenge

After completing the first part, edit `index.php` so that clicking a character will open a new page, `single.php`, that shows only the image of the character clicked. Hint: Enclose each image in an anchor tag and use query strings.
