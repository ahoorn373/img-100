## How to setup a lab or assignment
This course has labs and assignments that should be started from the designated templates. This can be done by following these steps:

1. Download the ZIP of this repository and extract it to a good place to work from on your computer. It will need to be somewhere in the "HTDOCS" folder to run PHP.

2. Open Github Desktop and select the `Add an Existing Repository from you Hard Drive...` option. Select the folder that you are working on. As an example, if you are looking to complete Lab 2 then you would select the `lab` folder inside `week2`.

3. You should get a warning that this directory does not appear to be a Git repository. Select the `create a repository` option provided.

4. Don't change the name of the repository and just leave the options as the defaults. Click `Create Repository`.

5. You should now have the option to open the repository in your external editor. You may need to change the preferences to make sure that this is VS Code.

6. The `Open in Visual Studio Code` button should open directly in the lab or assignment folder that you are working on.

7. Go ahead and complete the lab, using Github Desktop to make appropriate commits as you work.

8. Finally, use Github Desktop to publish the repository to your Github account. Ensure the repository is private with `chris-geelhoed` as a collaborator.
