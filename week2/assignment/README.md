Edit `confirmation.php` to output a confirmation message to a user after they submit the email subscription form.

For example, if the user submits a first name of `Maggie` with an email of `maggie.simpson@hotmail.com` the following message would be seen by the user:

"Thank you for subscribing Maggie! We've sent a confirmation email to maggie.simpson@hotmail.com!"

(Off course, no actual email will be sent)

Note that the form at `index.html` is already complete, you will only need to edit `confirmation.php`.
