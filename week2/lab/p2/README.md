Edit `index.html` to be an HTML form that accepts inputs for a person's first name, last name, and email address. Ensure that all 3 form inputs are required fields.

Set the form's action to be `thankyou.php`, and edit the PHP script to output a thank you message that includes the person's full name.

For example, if the user inputted a first name of `Kent` and a last name of `Brockman`, they would see an output of `Thank you Kent Brockman!`
