Using the `$name` and `$occupation` variables provided in `concatenate.php` and `interpolate.php`, echo a string that matches the following template:

"Hello, my name is _blank_ and my occupation is _blank_."

For example, if the `$name` variable is set to `Millhouse` and the `$occupation` variable is set to `Student`, you should echo:

"Hello, my name is Millhouse and my occupation is Student."
